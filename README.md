# Windowless-Executable

## Description

A Win32 executable that does nothing. No windows, no operations, nothing. Just perpetually sleeps.

## Usage

Just launch it. That's about it. You can run it through Steam if you want to set your Steam status (ie with a non-Steam game shortcut).

## Compiling

### Using Visual Studio tools

```
cl main.c /SUBSYSTEM
```
